title: GCI 2019 -- A slow but steady start

Google Code-in 2019 has started earlier this week and I was able to get right
into completing tasks the day it started. I'm focused on contributing to
Julia Programming Language this year. I've been interested in learning more
about Machine Learning a lot and contributing to Julia would get me a very good
start towards that.

Till now I have completed about three tasks with the fourth one submitted for
review. All the three tasks I was able to complete introduced me slightly to
the Julia syntax. I never actually sat down and learned all syntax, since I
believe that is very time consuming and you might just easily forget those.
Instead practicing makes much more sense and you won't forget that easily once
you've done some work with them.

I expect to complete the fourth task by today itself, assuming the mentors would
be active later tonight. I hope I'll keep updating this blog with much more
posts. I might just have a blog post on the fourth task if it is at least
partially accepted by the mentors.
