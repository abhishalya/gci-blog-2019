So, it has been few days since the week 1 of the GCI 2019 has ended. I was
very very active during the first week. It is definitely hard to handle the
school work as well as GCI at the same time. The weekends are especially
hectic since we just have to do a lot considering the time we get there.

I was almost hurrying everyone to review the tasks, etc. I later realized that
it is being a bit too much and I should eventually stop pushing the mentors.
But, that gave me a very good start. I was able to complete ~9 tasks in the
first week itself which is great I think since last year I was able to do
10 tasks in total!

The week 2 is on, and I'm going a bit slower than last week but I don't mind
it. I believe its not about winning to me. I probably won't be able to visit
US even if I won. So, I'm just trying to get my best in the competition and
learn something from every minute I'm spending on the tasks. So I'm choosing
the tasks which would help me learn something. Maybe that's not an efficient
strategy if you have to win, but surely you'll learn a lot that way and that
will definitely help you later.

Finally, I'm really thankful to the mentors of Julia since they tolerated my
messages/questions. (I do ask a lot of questions :P)
